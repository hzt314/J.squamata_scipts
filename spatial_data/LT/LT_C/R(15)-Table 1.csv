"r, U and L values are adjusted by the correction factor.  Uncorrected values are shown as r uc, U uc, L uc.  Bootstrap mean, Ur, Lr are also adjusted by the correction factor.",,,,,,,
Upper (Ur error) and lower (Lr error) error bars bound the 95% confidence interval about r as determined by bootstrap resampling.,,,,,,,
Upper (U) and lower (L) confidence limits bound the 95% confidence interval about the null hypothesis of No spatial structure for the combined data set as determined by permutation.,,,,,,,
